            Does your icon have lot of details and some fancy effects applied? If yes, use a bitmap.
             If not, consider using a vector image. For bitmaps use a jpg, png or a gif, for vectors the best choice
              would be a SVG or an icon font. Each has some benefits and some drawbacks.
               However keep in mind the size -- no pictures should go online without optimization.
                Vectors on the other hand often are tiny, but some older browsers won't support it. Also, if it has lots
                of curves, it might be heavier than a bitmap, so choose wisely.
